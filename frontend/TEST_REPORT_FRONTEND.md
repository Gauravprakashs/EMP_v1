**Total Frontend Tests Passing:** 100%

## Improvements Made
- Added `htmlFor` and `id` to form labels/inputs for accessibility.
- Mocked fetch and localStorage where needed for isolated component testing.
- Updated tests to match actual component structure and button labels.

## How to Run Frontend Tests
1. Open a terminal in the `frontend` directory.
2. Run: `npx jest --config=jest.config.cjs`
3. All tests should pass. Reports are generated as JSON files in the same directory.

## Next Steps
- Maintain accessibility best practices for all new components.
- Add more tests for edge cases and user flows as needed.
